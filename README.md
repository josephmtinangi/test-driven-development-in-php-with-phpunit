# Test-Driven Development in PHP with PHPUnit

## Unit testing
- Software testing method
- Individual units of source code tested
- Determines whether code is fit for use

>> Unit testing is testing isolated units of code to ensure correctness.

Unit of code - a single function or method

## TDD
- Write Test
- Run Test
- Write Code
- Run test
- Repeat until completed

## Why Unit Test?
- Ensures code works correctly
  - Tests are run multiple times
  - Test first, code change second
- Additional documentation
  - How to use a method
- Reduces the chance of bugs
  - TDD produces less bugs
- Improves the ability to refactor
- Helps to write better designed code

## Agile Software Development
- Increased quality
- Ease of coding
- More focused planning and design
- Enabled timely feedback
- Less bugs with TDD

## Automated vs. Manual Testing
### Automated Unit Testing
- Similar to conventional testing by hand
- Automated tests
- Isolated tests
- No forgotten or missed tests

## Other types of testing
- Integration
- Functional
- Behaviour
- Acceptance
